# queryUser

This golang program will send an HTML/CSS/JavaScript script to the 
BulletinBoard for displaying. If the script is setup right, anything 
the user puts into the displayed page is returned to the command line 
as a JSON structure. Therefore, you can make any dialogue you want! Great 
for giving a GUI frontend to a cli program.
